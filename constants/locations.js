  "history":
  "Dating back to the 8th century, Eklingji Temple was originally built by Bappa Rawal, the founder of the Mewar dynasty. Over the centuries, it was rebuilt and expanded by successive Mewar rulers, most notably by Maharana Kumbha. The temple became the spiritual seat of the Mewar kingdom, where rulers considered themselves servants of Eklingji, ruling as his representatives. This fusion of devotion and sovereignty gave the temple immense religious and political significance. Today, Eklingji is still worshipped as the presiding deity and eternal guardian of Mewar.",

It was founded by Rawat Chunda Singh, the eldest son of Maharana Lakha, and became one of the prominent estates in the Mewar region. The Salumber Fort and nearby royal structures like Hadi Rani Mahal reflect the town’s strategic and cultural significance. After India’s independence, it became part of Udaipur district, and in 2023, it was elevated to district status, continuing its legacy as a center of local governance and heritage.`,

                            "description": `Banswara, located in the southernmost part of Rajasthan, is famously known as the "City of Hundred Islands" due to numerous islets in the Mahi River. Nestled in the lush Aravalli hills, it is considered one of the greenest areas in Rajasthan and is often called the "Cherrapunji of Rajasthan" for its high rainfall. The region is rich in tribal culture, especially of the Bhil community, and features natural beauty with lakes, waterfalls, and ancient temples. Attractions like Anand Sagar Lake, Mahi Dam, and local fairs make Banswara a serene and culturally vibrant destination.`,
                            "history": `Historically, Banswara was inhabited by Bhil tribes and named after Bhil chieftain Bansiya, who was defeated by Maharawal Jagmal Singh in the 16th century, thus founding the princely state in 1515. Later, it became a British protectorate in 1818 and continued as a feudatory state until merging into modern Rajasthan after India's independence. Banswara holds a significant place in tribal history, especially due to the 1913 Mangarh Dham massacre, where over 1,500 Bhils were killed during a peaceful protest led by social reformer Govind Guru. The town's legacy blends royal, tribal, and resistance history.`,
